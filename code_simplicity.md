# Code Simplicity


One of the goals of a science of software design should be:
	To allow us to write software that is as helpful as possible.
Second goal is:
	To allow our software to continue to be as helpful as possible.
Third goal:
	To design systems that can be created and maintained as easily as possible by their programmers, so that they can be—and continue to be—as helpful as possible.


The desirability of a change is directly proportional to the value now plus the future
value, and inversely proportional to the effort of implementation plus the effort of
maintenance.

Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you
think will happen in the future.

Be only as generic as you know you need to be right now.

Law of Defect Probability:
The chance of introducing a defect into your program is proportional to the size of the changes you make to it.

what the ideal design is:
The best design is the one that allows for the most change in the environment with the least change in the software.

Never “fix” anything unless it’s a problem, and you have evidence showing that the problem really exists.


In any particular system, any piece of information should, ideally, exist only once.

Law of Simplicity:
The ease of maintenance of any piece of software is proportional to the simplicity of its individual pieces.

Names should be long enough to fully communicate what something is or does without being so long that they become hard to read.

Complexity builds on complexity - it’s not just a linear thing.

Most difficult design problems can be solved by simply drawing or writing them out on paper.

The Law of Testing:
The degree to which you know how your software behaves is the degree to which you have accurately tested it.
