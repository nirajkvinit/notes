How many times have you felt these emotions while trading?
• Hope: I sure hope this goes up right after I buy it.
• Fear: I can’t take another loss; I’ll sit this one out.
• Greed: I’m making so much money, I’m going to double my position.
• Despair: This trading system doesn’t work; I keep losing money.

some of the cognitive biases that affect trading:
• Loss aversion: The tendency for people to have a strong
preference for avoiding losses over acquiring gains
• Sunk costs effect: The tendency to treat money that already
has been committed or spent as more valuable than money
that may be spent in the future
• Disposition effect: The tendency for people to lock in gains
and ride losses
• Outcome bias: The tendency to judge a decision by its
outcome rather than by the quality of the decision at the
time it was made
• Recency bias: The tendency to weigh recent data or
experience more than earlier data or experience
• Anchoring: The tendency to rely too heavily, or anchor, on
readily available information
• Bandwagon effect: The tendency to believe things because
many other people believe them
• Belief in the law of small numbers: The tendency to draw
unjustified conclusions from too little information


speculative markets exist in one of four
states:
• Stable and quiet: Prices tend to stay within a relatively
small range with little movement up or down outside that
range.
• Stable and volatile: There are large daily or weekly changes,
but without major changes over a period of months.
• Trending and quiet: There is slow movement or drift in prices
when measured over a period of months but without severe
retracement or price movement in the opposite direction.
• Trending and volatile: There are large changes in price
accompanied by occasional significant shorter-term reversals
of direction.
