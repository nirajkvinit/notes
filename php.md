Grumpy Programmer
* Learn and use PHP Code Sniffer, PHP Mess Detector, PHP Copy Paste Detector, Mockery mock object framework
* Complexity is the enemy of maintainability and extendability
* Less code means less bugs
* Dependency Injection Containers
* If you can’t automate a test for it, then it’s broken.
* Like An Onion, Your Application Has Layers
* Learn something new every day, is my motto.
* If you’ve ever worked on an application where you were afraid to make changes for fear of breaking something, then you have run into technical debt.
* Pay now, or pay later, but you will PAY to fix bugs in your application. Paying now is simply cheaper.
